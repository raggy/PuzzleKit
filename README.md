# PuzzleKit for Godot 4

*This is very early in development, but might turn into something usable eventually?*

The goals for this add-on are to provide a quick-to-setup, but flexible structure for high-quality 3D grid-based puzzle games, such as Cosmic Express and A Monster's Expedition. My current thoughts on what might be universal enough to include are:
- Board/piece state tracking and querying
- Piece animation system with queuing and simple tweening defaults
- Undo history and checkpointing
- Save/load system
- Level editing tools (probably a version that you can lay pieces out along a plane, and a version that lets you build out complex 3D structures)
